# Yet another Chip-8 emulator
I made this project to learn more about how computers work.

Please note, this is an Eclipse project file.

To run the emulator, you must point the variables audioString and romString, located at src\chip\Main.java, to beep.wav and pong2.c8 files.
Both files are included in this repository
